Run mission code
Have mission code send out signal that currently shows 
  what drone is doing
If what ever the mission code is doing aligns with 
  output of serial-comm 
  	(either it's outputting the same movement or "C" for
  	continue)
then continue doing mission

Otherwise look at alternatives
stop? 
design a plan to go to in different direction
